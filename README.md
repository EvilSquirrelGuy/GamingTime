# GamingTime

Something that may end up being a gaming time tracker, who knows...


## Setup

I'm developing this on macOS, so I cba writing instructions for Windows/Linux, figure it out yourself :p

Before running the project, you'll need to install `rust` and `bun`. You can use the handy dandy command below to install them:

```shell
$ brew install rust bun
```

There, now you can go to the next bit.


## Running

This app is made using Tauri+ReactJS, and uses `bun`. Make sure you have `bun`.

1. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   $ bun install
   ```

2. Run tauri preview
   ```shell
   $ bun run tauri preview
   ```

3. Profit


## Developing

idk why you'd want to contribute to this, but just keep the code style the same as the existing stuff or your pull request gets deleted :)
